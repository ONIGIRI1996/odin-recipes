  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>0.5 pcs. vanilla pod</li>
    <li>shell of 0.5 pcs. lemon</li>
    <li>160 g wheat flour</li>
    <li>60 g icing sugar </li>
    <li>85 g of butter</li>
    <li>0.5 pcs. egg</li>
    <p><strong>Lemon Cream</strong></p>
    <li>2 pcs. gelatin plates</li>
    <li>2 dl lemon juice</li>
    <li>5 pcs. egg</li>
    <li>2 dl sugar</li>
    <li>125 g unsalted butter in cubes</li>
    <p><strong>Meringue</strong></p>
    <li>2 pcs. egg white</li>
    <li>0.25 teaspoons of salt</li>
    <li>85 g of sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Split a vanilla pod in half lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds with a small, pointed knife. Grate lemon zest (only the yellow). Put the vanilla seeds and lemon zest in a food processor together with the flour, icing sugar and butter and blend quickly. Add eggs and beat until the dough is properly assembled. Pour the dough onto the kitchen counter and knead it well. Wrap the dough well and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Roll out the dough between two sheets of baking paper to a sheet that is 2-3 mm thick, remove the baking paper and line a pie tin, 22 cm in diameter. Cut away the excess dough, prick the base with a fork and put the mold in the cold for 10 minutes. The pie is baked at 180 °C until it has acquired a golden and nice colour, approx. 12 minutes. Cool down.  </li>
    <li> Place gelatin in cold water, 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Put lemon juice, eggs and sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. Make sure it doesn't burn. Squeeze the water out of the gelatin and add it to the mixture when it has thickened. Stir until the gelatin is dissolved and remove the pan from the plate. Cool the mixture, but not so long that the gelatin has set completely. </li>
    <li> Whisk in cubes of butter little by little into the cooled mixture and pour the mixture into the pie crust. Refrigerate the pie until it hardens, a minimum of 2-3 hours. </li>
    <li> Place egg whites in a clean, dry glass or stainless steel bowl. Beat them together slowly with a little salt until they form a soft foam. Increase the speed until the bubbles in the foam are small and even. When the foam forms stiff peaks, add sugar, a little at a time. Beat until the mixture is soft and glossy and all the sugar has dissolved. Do not beat for too long or the mixture will become grainy.</li>
    <li> Place the meringue in a piping bag with a round tip, and pipe the meringue in small peaks onto the stiff lemon tart. Use a ski burner/créme brûlée burner and burn until you get a nice color on the meringue.</li>
